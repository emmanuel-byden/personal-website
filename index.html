            <p>"Hi everyone, I'm Emmanuel!  I'm fueled by two passions that might seem worlds apart: the intricate logic of coding and the raw energy of rugby.  Whether I'm debugging a tricky piece of code or strategizing on the rugby pitch, I thrive on challenges that push me to think creatively and work as part of a team.  I'm excited to share a bit of my journey with you.".</p>

            <p>"When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll find me on the rugby pitch. I've always been drawn to the sport's dynamic nature, the blend of strategy and physicality. One of my proudest moments was reaching the national level in rugby 7s. Representing my region and competing against the best teams in the country was an incredible experience.  It taught me the value of dedication, teamwork, and pushing beyond my limits.  The thrill of the competition, the camaraderie of the team, and the satisfaction of a hard-fought victory are feelings I'll always cherish."</p>
